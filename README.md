# Project-Elelctrical-Load-Profile-Analysis-and-Peak-Load-Assesment-using-Statistical-Modeling
A methodology that relates climate parameters to Peak Demand at county level scales has been applied to six states in the Independent System Operator (ISO) New England region to predict daily peak demand. These models allow for detailed analyses of electricity demand and its vulnerabilities to climate change at county level scale. The results include the comparison between various models and indicate the best model for predicting the daily peak demand significantly.
